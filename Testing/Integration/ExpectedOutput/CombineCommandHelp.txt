Take matrices of grid or list format (see general help) and combine
them to produce a matrix with all elements of the input matrices.
Where input matrices share elements the values will be added together.

Usage examples:
    Disperse.exe combine -m GridA.csv,GridB.csv -i ListA+B.csv
    Disperse.exe combine -l ListA.csv,ListB.csv -r GridA+B.csv

Options:
    -m Input matrix/matrices as grid CSV file(s), one file name or two separated by a comma
    -l Input matrix/matrices as list(s) of non-zero matrix elements, one file name or two separated by a comma
    -r Output matrix as grid CSV file
    -i Output matrix as list of non-zero matrix elements
    -a Add a column with all values set to this value (intended to be for a shared, global, market risk)
    -b Give a column created with -a the this heading (rather than the default)
