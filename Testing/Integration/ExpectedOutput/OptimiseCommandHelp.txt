Take a list of securities with expected returns, variances and correlations and a minimum target return
and generate the portfolio with the minimum predicted variance that will generate the expected return

Usage:    Disperse.exe optimise [optional arguments] [securities input file] [securities output file] [minimum expected return]
The securities input file should be a CSV containing the securities which can be included in the optimised portfolio.
It should have columns:
    'Security' - An identifier of the security such as the ISIN or name (required)
    'Expected' - The expected return (optional, default 0)
    'Risk'     - A value proportional to the risk, such as the standard deviation of annual returns (optional, default 0)
    'Min'      - The minimum weighting the security can have in the final portfolio (optional, default 0)
    'Max'      - The maximum weighting the security can have in the final portfolio (optional, default 1)
    'Group'    - An optional group name, allowing minimum and maximum weightings for some securities and thus also portfolio parts
The minimum expected return should be a number of the same units as the 'Expected' column of the securities input file.

Usage examples:
    Disperse.exe optimise -p OutputFactorWeightings.csv IndependentSecurities.csv OutputPortfolio.csv 7.0
    Disperse.exe optimise -m CorrelationMatrix.csv -p OutputFactorWeightings.csv Securities.csv OutputPortfolio.csv 7.0
    Disperse.exe optimise -m CorrelationMatrix.csv -g ISAandPensionGroups.csv -p OutputFactorWeightings.csv Securities.csv OutputPortfolio.csv 5.0
    Disperse.exe optimise -m CorrelationMatrix.csv -l FundOverlap.csv Securities.csv OutputPortfolio.csv 5.0

Optional arguments:
    -m Input security full correlation matrix as a CSV file(s)
    -l Input security sparse correlation matrix as a list of non-zero matrix elements
    -g Input file name listing groups mentioned in the securities file with their minimum and maximum weights in the generated portfolio
    -f Output file name for the weightings of each factor in the optimised portfolio
    -p Output file name for the weighting of each group in the optimised portfolio
If used, the full correlation matrix CSV file should have column and row headings that are the securitiy names.
If both - m or -l are supplied, the values of shared elements are added. Correlation matrix values must be between 0 and 1.
The group input file (if supplied) should be a CSV file with headings:
    'Group' - An identifier of the group as used in the security file
    'Min'   - The minimum proportion of the portfolio that can be occupied by securities labelled with the group (optional, default 0)
    'Max'   - The maximum proportion of the portfolio that can be occupied by securities labelled with the group (optional, default 1)
