Take a list of securities with expected returns, variances and risk factors and a minimum target return
and generate the portfolio with the minimum predicted variance that will generate the expected return

Usage:    Disperse.exe optimise [optional arguments] [securities input file] [securities output file] [minimum expected return]
The securities input file should be a CSV containing the securities which can be included in the optimised portfolio.
It should have columns:
    'Security' - An identifier of the security such as the ISIN or name (required)
    'Expected' - The expected return (optional, default 0)
    'Risk'     - A value proportional to the risk, such as the standard deviation of annual returns (optional, default 0)
    'Min'      - The minimum weighting the security can have in the final portfolio (optional, default 0)
    'Max'      - The maximum weighting the security can have in the final portfolio (optional, default 1)
    'Group'    - An optional group name, allowing minimum and maximum weightings for some securities and thus also portfolio parts
The minimum expected return should be a number of the same units as the 'Expected' column of the securities input file.

Usage examples:
    Disperse.exe optimise -p OutputFactorWeightings.csv IndependentSecurities.csv OutputPortfolio.csv 7.0
    Disperse.exe optimise -m RiskFactors.csv -p OutputFactorWeightings.csv Securities.csv OutputPortfolio.csv 7.0
    Disperse.exe optimise -m RiskFactors.csv -g ISAandPensionGroups.csv -p OutputFactorWeightings.csv Securities.csv OutputPortfolio.csv 5.0
    Disperse.exe optimise -m RiskFactors.csv -l FundOverlap.csv Securities.csv OutputPortfolio.csv 5.0

Optional arguments:
    -m Input security full risk matrix as a CSV file(s)
    -l Input security sparse risk matrix as a list of non-zero matrix elements
    -g Input file name listing groups mentioned in the securities file with their minimum and maximum weights in the generated portfolio
    -f Output file name for the weightings of each factor in the optimised portfolio
    -p Output file name for the weighting of each group in the optimised portfolio

A risk factor matrix indicates the proportion of the variablility in the value of the securities explained by
independent risk factors.
The sum of the risk factors for a security must be less than or equal to 1.
The risk factor matrix is multiplied by itself to generate a security correlation matrix.
The total risk of each security (standard deviation of returns) from the security CSV table is then
used to turn this correlation matrix into the covariance matrix used in the optimisation.

See the general help ('Disperse.exe help') for details of full and sparse matrices.
A full risk factor matrix should have row headings corresponding to the security names and
column headings corresponding to independent risk factors.
A sparse risk factor matrix should have the security in the first column, the risk factor in the second
and the correlation in the third. There must be headings 'Row', 'Column' and 'Value' respectively.
If both -m and -l are supplied, the values of shared elements are added.

The group input file (if supplied) should be a CSV file with headings:
    'Group' - An identifier of the group as used in the security file
    'Min'   - The minimum proportion of the portfolio that can be occupied by securities labelled with the group (optional, default 0)
    'Max'   - The maximum proportion of the portfolio that can be occupied by securities labelled with the group (optional, default 1)
